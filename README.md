# Exploratory-Analysis-Cryptocoins
This github repository is meant to complement an [article](http://bengahtan.com/2017/09/bitcoin-exploratory.html) on my website.

Within this directory, there is a jupyter notebook where I explored:
- historical prices of cryptocoins
- correlations between currencies
- future price predictions

There is also an "input" directory that contains historical data on a wide array of cryptocoins dating back several years. The jupyter notebook can easily be modified to perform the above tasks on these currencies simply by changing the input variable.
